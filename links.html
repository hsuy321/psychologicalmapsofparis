                <a href="introduction.html">In</a>
                <o>Table 8.1</o> we have listed by rank, and irrespective
                of when the items
                appeared <a href="introduction.html">in</a> the subject's <a href="handdrawn-maps.html">in</a>,
                the fifty elements of the <a href="paris-as-a-collective-representation.html"> Paris</a> cityscape
                listed most frequently by the subjects.

            <p>
                No city consists of a set of isolated elements floating <a href="introduction.html">in</a> an urban
                vacuum, but some cities possess a
                dense set of pathways tying its varied monuments and squares together. A city is either barren or
                fertile, depending on the degree to which its varied elements are woven into an interconnected web. The
                sum becomes greater than the parts by virtue of their relationship to each other. To uncover the
                associational structures of <a href="paris-as-a-collective-representation.html"> Paris</a>, we posed the
                following problem to our subjects:
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                We shall name an element <a href="introduction.html">in</a> the <a
                    href="paris-as-a-collective-representation.html"> Paris</a> scene, then we would like you to wander
                with the mind's eye to the
                next specific element <a href="introduction.html">in</a> your own mental imagery, which we would then
                like you to write down. For
                example, if we say "Tour Eiffel" you might summon up the scene <a href="introduction.html">in</a> your
                mental imagery, probe around
                mentally, and say "Palais de Chaillot" or "Pont d'Iena," or you might think of the Champ de Mars.
                Whatever comes to mind as forming a natural connection is what interests us.

            <p>
                <a href="introduction.html">In</a> this way we hoped to see how the varied elements <a
                    href="introduction.html">in</a> the subject's mental structure of <a
                    href="paris-as-a-collective-representation.html"> Paris</a> were held
                together. The 20 stimulus locales that we provided the subjects are listed <a
                    href="introduction.html">in</a>
                <o>Table 8.2</o>.

            <br>
            <p>
                <a href="introduction.html">In</a> Column A we have indicated the number of links forged between each
                stimulus location and some other
                location by at least 10 percent of the subjects. For example, there are six such links for the Arc de
                Triomphe, five links for the Tour Eiffel, and so on. There is a great difference <a
                    href="introduction.html">in</a> the degree to which
                the different stimulus locales are embedded <a href="introduction.html">in</a> a context of mental
                associations. Among the most richly
                embedded sites are Arc de Triomphe, l'Opera, Notre Dame de <a
                    href="paris-as-a-collective-representation.html"> Paris</a>, and Pantheon. The most weakly embedded
                are Buttes Chaumont and Pere Lachaise.

            <br>
            <p>
                The structure of associations for two of the stimulus locales is shown <a
                    href="introduction.html">in</a> the "molecules" <a href="introduction.html">in</a>
                <o>Fig. 8.7</o>.

            <br>
            <p>
                By linking up the separate molecules at points of overlap, one may <a href="handdrawn-maps.html">in</a>
                the entire network of
                associations for the city, the reticulate structure of its images.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                A related measure of the "embeddedness" is the proportion of subjects who are unable to give any
                association whatsoever to a stimulus location. As Column B of <o>Table 8.2</o> shows, this varies
                greatly from
                one location to the next. Fewer than one percent of the subjects were unable to provide an association
                to the Arc de Triomphe, while 34 percent were unable to provide any association for the Pare de
                Montsouris. The former is a well-embedded element, while the latter is poorly articulated with the main
                structure of the city.

                Although we asked our subjects to concentrate on geographic, visual elements, they often included purely
                <a href="social-perceptions.html">social</a> or historical features such as "La Guillotine" or
                "clochards," as if these elements could simply
                not be excluded from the meaning of a particular locale. We used this information to create an
                additional <a href="handdrawn-maps.html">in</a> (<o>Fig. 8.8</o>); one <a
                    href="introduction.html">in</a> which
                each locale is surrounded by the verbal associations it stimulated.
