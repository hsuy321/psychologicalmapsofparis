                Altogether our subjects entered 4,132 elements in their maps, an average of 19 for each subject. If the
                city did not impress on its inhabitants a sense of its structure, its highlights and nodes, we would
                find little agreement among the subjects. But, in fact, time and again we find the same locations,
                showing up in the handdrawn maps.Indeed, about half of all the 4,132 elements are accounted for by only
                26 locations.

                We need to translate the frequency of information into cartographic form. Perhaps we can take a cue from
                Rand McNally. When the population of a city is large, Rand McNally translates this information into BOLD
                TYPOGRAPHY, and the population of a small city is expressed by smaller print. In Fig. 8.6 we have shown
                the names of the locales, streets, and monuments in a size proportional to the number of people who
                cited them; that is, in proportion to their salience to the Parisians.

                Parisians like to say that there is a tourist Paris, but the real Paris is something quite apart. But if
                we examine the maps produced by the subjects, we see that time and again tourist Paris-the famous
                monuments and landmarks-reappears as the basic structuring devices in their own productions of the city.
                Paris is integral, and it is not possible to efface l'Etoile, the Louvre, and others from any
                intelligent representation of the city.

                In scoffing at tourist Paris, Parisians imply they have access to a much deeper treasure, and choose to
                dissociate themselves from the city's public aspect. But, of course, the very greatness of Paris and its
                attraction to millions reside in its very availability as a city.
