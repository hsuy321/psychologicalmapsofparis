                A city is a social fact. We would all agree to that. But we need to add an important corollary: the
                perception of a city is also a social fact, and as such needs to be studied <a
                    href="introduction.html">in</a> its collective as well as
                its individual aspect. It is not only what exists but what is highlighted by the community that acquires
                salience <a href="introduction.html">in</a> the mind of the person. A city is as much a collective
                representation as it is an assemblage
                of streets, squares, and buildings. We discern the <a href="the-major-elements.html">major</a>
                ingredients of that representation by studying
                not only the mental <a href="handdrawn-maps.html">map</a> <a href="introduction.html">in</a> a specific
                individual, but by seeing what is
                shared among individuals. Toward
                this end, we turn from the clinical use of individual maps to an actuarial analysis of the entire group
                of maps provided by the subjects.
