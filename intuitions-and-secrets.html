            <p>
                Before drawing the report to a close, we wish to make a few additional observations about <a
                    href="paris-as-a-collective-representation.html">Paris</a> and the
                processes of its mental representation. A person may know many things about a city while not being aware
                that he possesses such knowledge; and such implicit knowledge may be widely shared. Consider the
                following hypothetical situation we presented to the subjects:
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Suppose you were to meet someone in <a href="paris-as-a-collective-representation.html">Paris</a>, a
                person whom you had never met before, and you knew the
                exact date and time of the meeting, but not the place. Assume the person you were to meet operated under
                the similar handicap of not knowing where you would wait for him. Where in <a
                    href="paris-as-a-collective-representation.html">Paris</a> would you wait so as to
                maximize the chances of encountering the person?
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Subjects were encouraged to use their intuition in answering the question, but this did not prevent many
                of them from denouncing the question as illogical, stupid, and unanswerable. But those who responded (N
                = 188) demonstrated that a set of appropriate-even intelligent responses was possible. (An answer to
                this question may be considered "appropriate" if it is selected by a large number of other respondents,
                and thus represents a shared intuition of where others are likely to wait.) Two principles governed the
                choice of locales: (a) some subjects selected a location that was unequivocally representative of the
                city, (b) other subjects chose locales that by custom and practice had become institutionalized waiting
                places (much as the clock at Grand Central Station in New York serves this function).
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Six locations accounted for more than SO percent of all answers, as Table 8.6 shows. The largest number
                of Parisians indicated they would wait by the Eiffel Tower, the preeminent symbol of <a
                    href="paris-as-a-collective-representation.html">Paris</a> in modern
                times. (What would the dominant response have been prior to its construction in 1889? We have no
                psychological maps to tell us.) The second most popular choice was the Monument des Morts at the Gare
                St. Lazare. The consensus generated by this question shows that the inhabitants share an implicit,
                intuitive knowledge of the city that can be crystalized given the proper stimulus.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                A second observation is that even poorly known areas of a city may exercise a fascination for the
                inhabitant: thus, three-fourths of the subjects answered affirmatively when asked if there was any part
                of <a href="paris-as-a-collective-representation.html">Paris</a> they did not know well but were
                attracted to. (The most popular choice was le Marais, a once
                unfashionable area that has recently experienced a renaissance.) And subjects generated the names of 155
                different locales when asked if they had come across any places of particular beauty or interest that
                were unknown to the general public. Among their responses were: quaint provincial streets off the Pare
                de Montsouris; Villa Montmorency, a rustic residential enclave of several acres into which the noise of
                the surrounding streets scarcely penetrates; the courtyards off the Rue de Sevres, which represent the
                inner folds of the convoluted brain of <a href="paris-as-a-collective-representation.html">Paris</a>,
                providing a great deal more surface area than a mere
                skimming of the surface would suggest; Canal St. Martin; Place des Peupliers; Cour du Rohan, and
                numerous others. Many of the so-called "places of beauty" were actually cited by a large number of
                subjects, yet more important is the subject's attitude that the city yields some secrets to him alone,
                and that <a href="paris-as-a-collective-representation.html">Paris</a> is intricate, variegated, and
                inexhaustible in its offerings.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                But it is false to end this report as a panegyric. For many Parisians assert that the city is declining
                in quality, succumbing to vehicular pollution, noise, and the flight of artisans from the city; they
                assert that urban renewal is destroying a good deal of the beauty of <a
                    href="paris-as-a-collective-representation.html">Paris</a>, and they locate its worst
                effects in the 15th, 1st, and 13th arrondissements, where modern apartment buildings and office towers
                have replaced the greater charm, but also the greater decrepitude, of the older structures.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The problem for modern <a href="paris-as-a-collective-representation.html">Paris</a>, then, is to learn
                something about the transmutation of charm into its
                contemporary forms, and to learn it quickly, before the old is brutally replaced by the new, and only
                the street patterns remain.
