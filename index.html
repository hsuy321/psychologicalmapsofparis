                <a href="introduction.html">In</a> this paper we described a number of psychological <a
                    href="handdrawn-maps.html">maps</a> of <a href="paris-as-a-collective-representation.html">Paris</a>
                generated by its inhabitants,
                detailed representations of the city expressed <a href="introduction.html">in</a> cartographic form,
                rather than as simple opinions,
                attitudes, and words. The peculiar value of such mental <a href="handdrawn-maps.html">maps</a> is that
                they tease out the person’s view of
                a city <a href="introduction.html">in</a> a way that permits a ready comparison with the reality. They
                allow a treatment of the city’s
                spatial character <a href="introduction.html">in</a> a way that words frequently avoid. And they show
                how urban space is encoded,
                distorted, and selectively represented, while yet retaining its usefulness to the person. For the image
                of the city is not just extra mental baggage; it is the necessary accompaniment to living <a
                    href="introduction.html">in</a> a complex
                and highly variegated environment.

                Such <a href="handdrawn-maps.html">maps</a> are multi-dimensional.
                They contain cognitive
                and also emotional and intuitive components, and
                a variety of procedures is needed to bring them to light. The <a href="handdrawn-maps.html">maps</a> are
                not only individual products;
                they are shaped by social factors, and therefore acquire the status of a collective representations—that
                is, symbolic configurations of belief and knowledge promoted and disseminated by the culture.
