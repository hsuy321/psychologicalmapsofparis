                To begin, our 218 subjects, drawn from each of the 20 arrondissements
                (i.e., administrative sectors) of Paris in proportion to their numbers, were asked to draw a map of
                Paris in which they were to mention all of the elements of the city that came to mind; they could
                illustrate their maps with monuments, squares, neighborhoods, streets, or whatever elements
                spontaneously occurred to them. They were told further that their sketch should not resemble a tourist
                map of Paris, but ought to express their personal view. Let us now consider the maps of some of the
                subjects:

            <br>
            <p>
                Map 108 (Fig. 8.1). The subject is a 25-year-old commercial agent, with university degrees in physical
                chemistry. His first entries on the map were Boulevard St. Germain and St. Michel, then the Faculte des
                Sciences at Jussieu, suggesting that his student experience remains dominant. The modern structures of
                the Zamanski Tower at the Faculte des Sciences and the SO-story Maine-Montparnasse office tower are
                prominently shown. Youthful subjects, more often than their elders, include these contemporary elements
                as if the mental maps of the old were internalized a long time ago and cannot admit these recent
                additions. Rising in the northwest, the massive office complex, La Defense, is given an almost
                projective significance, as it hovers menacingly alongside the city. The map expresses the central
                dilemma of contemporary Paris: how can it preserve its distinctive character, formed in earlier
                centuries, while coming to grips with modernity?
