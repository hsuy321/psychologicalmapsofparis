                To begin, our 218 subjects, drawn from each of the 20 arrondissements
                (i.e., administrative sectors) of <a href="paris-as-a-collective-representation.html">Paris</a> <a
                    href="introduction.html">in</a> proportion to their numbers,
                were asked to draw a map of
                <a href="paris-as-a-collective-representation.html">Paris</a> <a href="introduction.html">in</a> which
                they were to mention all of the <a href="emerging-elements.html">elements</a> of the city that
                came to mind; they could
                illustrate their maps with monuments, squares, neighborhoods, streets, or whatever <a
                    href="emerging-elements.html">elements</a>
                spontaneously occurred to them. They were told further that their sketch should not resemble a tourist
                map of <a href="paris-as-a-collective-representation.html">Paris</a>, but ought to express their
                personal view. Let us now consider the maps of some of the
                subjects:

                Map 108 (<o>Fig. 8.1</o>). The subject is a 25-year-old commercial agent, with university degrees <a
                    href="introduction.html">in</a> physical
                chemistry. His first entries on the map were Boulevard St. Germain and St. Michel, then the Faculte des
                Sciences at Jussieu, suggesting that his student experience remains dominant. The modern structures of
                the Zamanski Tower at the Faculte des Sciences and the SO-story Maine-Montparnasse office tower are
                prominently shown. Youthful subjects, more often than their elders, include these contemporary <a
                    href="emerging-elements.html">elements</a>
                as if the mental maps of the old were internalized a long time ago and cannot admit these recent
                additions. Rising <a href="introduction.html">in</a> the northwest, the massive office complex, La
                Defense, is given an almost
                projective significance, as it hovers menacingly alongside the city. The map expresses the central
                dilemma of contemporary <a href="paris-as-a-collective-representation.html">Paris</a>: how can it
                preserve its distinctive character, formed <a href="introduction.html">in</a> earlier
                centuries, while coming to grips with modernity?

                Map 070 (<o>Fig. 8.2</o>). Map 070 is drawn by a SO-year-old woman who, at the time of the interview,
                lived <a href="introduction.html">in</a>
                the
                12th arrondissement; however, for 15 years she had resided <a href="introduction.html">in</a> the 4th,
                which she maps with scrupulous
                detail, even to the point of indicating the one-way street directions for automobiles. She centers her
                map
                not on <a href="paris-as-a-collective-representation.html">Paris</a> as a whole, but on a segment of it
                that has special meaning to her. Yet she is able to <a href="links.html">link</a>
                her
                personal experience to highly public landmarks such as the Louvre and the Palais Royale. Perhaps it is
                characteristic of <a href="paris-as-a-collective-representation.html">Paris</a> that one can readily
                fuse private and public aspects of life through the network
                of
                streets and landmarks.

                Map 215 (<o>Fig. 8.3</o>). This subject is a 33-year-old butcher who lives <a
                    href="introduction.html">in</a>
                the 11th arrondissement. At first
                the
                map looks confusing, but we begin to discern the <a href="emerging-elements.html">elements</a> of a set
                of life circumstances when we examine
                it
                closely. He does not forget to include his home arrondissement, which is something of a hidden one to
                most
                subjects. Nor does he neglect La Villette, where the <a href="the-major-elements.html">major</a>
                stockyards and slaughterhouses of <a href="paris-as-a-collective-representation.html">Paris</a> are
                to be
                found. One can imagine his visits to the great exposition hall at the Porte de Versailles, to see
                displays
                of meat cutting equipment, motorcycles, and perhaps automobiles. Faubourg St. Antoine, of revolutionary
                significance, is placed on the Left Bank, where it would seem to belong politically.
                We are most confused, perhaps, by the inverted curvature he has given to the Seine; the disposition of
                <a href="emerging-elements.html">elements</a> along the river seem all out of line with reality. Yet if
                Etoile, Maison de la Radio, and the
                Porte
                de St. Cloud deviate from their true spatial coordinates, they do preserve a meaningful topological
                sequence.

            <p>
                Map 037 (<o>Fig. 8.4</o>). A mental map is not limited to reality, but may incorporate visions of how a
                city
                ought
                to be. This subject, an architect, organizes the city around the Place de la Concorde. He envisages a
                <a href="the-major-elements.html">major</a>
                avenue stretching south from the Place, over the Seine, piercing the Chambre des Deputes, and continuing
                south into the heart of the Left Bank, terminating <a href="introduction.html">in</a> an impressive
                structure (as yet unrealized). From
                that
                point, a broad avenue would sweep northwest to reveal the Eiffel Tower, and another northeast leading to
                the
                colonnade of Madeleine (displaced from its present location). Such mental maps are fanciful. Yet <a
                    href="paris-as-a-collective-representation.html">Paris</a>
                as it
                exists was born first as a set of ideas, and the <a
                    href="paris-as-a-collective-representation.html">Paris</a> to come is also germinating <a
                    href="introduction.html">in</a> the minds of
                architects and city planners. The subject's concern with problems of automobile traffic represents a
                realistic attention to the city's most severe environmental problem.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                It is clear the subjects did not merely derive their maps from personal, direct experience with the
                city.
                They learned them, <a href="introduction.html">in</a> part, from other maps. Street maps of <a
                    href="paris-as-a-collective-representation.html">Paris</a>,
                prepared by technically skilled
                cartographers, are an inherent part of contemporary <a
                    href="recognition-of-parisian-scenes.html">Parisian</a> culture. Probably not a single subject
                could
                have generated a map of the city accurately showing its form and basic structure without reference <a
                    href="introduction.html">in</a>
                his
                own mind to maps he has already seen. But through processes of selectivity, emphasis, and distortion,
                the
                maps become projections of life styles, and express emotional cathexes of the participants.
                Second, neither the city, nor the mental maps of the city, are simple agglomerations of <a
                    href="emerging-elements.html">elements</a>; they
                are
                structures. It is the essence of structure that displacement of one <a
                    href="emerging-elements.html">element</a> is not an isolated event,
                but
                has consequences for the other <a href="emerging-elements.html">elements</a> with which it is <a
                    href="links.html">linked</a>.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Finally, a map that a person draws of his city is not his mental map, but is only a clue to it. He may
                not
                be able to draw very well; he may have images <a href="introduction.html">in</a> his mind which he
                cannot put on paper. He may make
                errors
                <a href="introduction.html">in</a> his initial strokes that complicate his later completion of the map.
                But still, the sketch is an
                opening
                into his conception of the city.
