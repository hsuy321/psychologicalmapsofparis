                The photographic recognition test tells us about the knowledge of specific landmarks, but we wanted a
                more general picture of the known and unknown parts of the city. Accordingly, we provided each subject
                with an illustrated <a href="handdrawn-maps.html">map</a> of the city, which we overprinted with the
                boundaries of the 80 administrative
                districts (quartiers). We asked each subject to study his <a href="handdrawn-maps.html">map</a> and
                indicate the ten quartiers with which
                he was most familiar, and those that were least familiar to him. By combining the response forall
                subjects, we generate a gradient of asserted familiarity across the entire city.
            </p>
            <br>
            <img class="blend" src="images/8.10 2.png">

            <p>
                The five most familiar quartiers are contiguous and center on the Quartier Latin and Ile de la Cite. The
                next five choices accrete to this cluster, but also extend to the Champs Elysees and Etoile. When
                subjects are asked to list the quartier they know least well, we find a striking movement away from the
                center of <a href="paris-as-a-collective-representation.html">Paris</a> to the peripheral
                arrondissements.
                <o>Figure 8.10</o> shows how these data, translated into respective arrondissements, delineate a ring of
                unknown areas around the core of <a href="paris-as-a-collective-representation.html">Paris</a>.
                Curiously, <a href="introduction.html">in</a> this <a href="handdrawn-maps.html">map</a> the boundary
                between known and unknown
                parts of the city retraces part of the route of the last wall of <a
                    href="paris-as-a-collective-representation.html">Paris</a>, the Fermiers Generaux. Although
                the wall was tom down <a href="introduction.html">in</a> 1859 its effects endure <a
                    href="introduction.html">in</a> the mental <a href="handdrawn-maps.html">maps</a> of contemporary
                Parisians, with the
                least familiar parts of the city lying outside the boundary where the wall once stood.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The residential patterns of <a href="paris-as-a-collective-representation.html">Paris</a> create a
                class
                basis to known and unknown parts of the city. Generally
                speaking, the wealthier segments of the population live <a href="introduction.html">in</a> the
                western
                part of the city, and the poorer
                classes live <a href="introduction.html">in</a> the east. It is not surprising, therefore, that the
                areas least known to the
                working-class subjects should differ from those of the middle-class professionals, as Table 8.4
                shows.
                While all of the least-known arrondissements are on the periphery of <a
                    href="paris-as-a-collective-representation.html">Paris</a>, there is no overlap between
                the class <a href="links.html">linked</a> perceptions. It is only a knowledge of the central
                arrondissements of <a href="paris-as-a-collective-representation.html">Paris</a> that is
                claimed by both groups.
