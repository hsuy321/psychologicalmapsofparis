                While ethnic turfs have a salient place in the representation of New York, with exception of the
                North
                African districts, and the Jewish quarter around St. Paul, they do not figure greatly in the mental
                <a href="handdrawn-maps.html">maps</a>
                of <a href="paris-as-a-collective-representation.html">Paris</a>. The city does not have the
                multiple
                ethnic concentrations found in New York, and areas are
                not
                selectively highlighted and affixed with an ethnic label, a process Suttles (1972) has shown to be
                important in the definition of ethnic neighborhoods. In pre-World War II <a
                    href="paris-as-a-collective-representation.html">Paris</a>, areas of the city
                were
                rich in residents from particular provinces, and subjects continue to identify the quartiers around
                Gare
                de Montparnasse as <a href="paris-as-a-collective-representation.html">Paris</a> des Bretons. On the
                other hand, the Chinese community that once flourished
                behind the Gare de Lyon receives no representation in the <a href="handdrawn-maps.html">maps</a> of
                contemporary <a href="recognition-of-parisian-scenes.html"><a
                        href="recognition-of-parisian-scenes.html">Parisians</a></a>.

                Subjects locate the very poor in the northeastern districts; while the wealthy are overwhelmingly
                situated in the 16th arrondissement, at the western edge of the city (<o>Table 8.5</o>). This is a
                sharply
                differentiated perception, with no geographic overlap between the two groups. The criminally
                dangerous
                areas of <a href="paris-as-a-collective-representation.html">Paris</a> are identified with the 18th
                and
                19th arrondissements, with the greatest threat to
                personal safety ascribed to the Goutte d'Or quartier, which houses many North African immigrants.
                The
                responses to several purely personal questions appear to derive from this rough socioeconomic <a
                    href="handdrawn-maps.html">map</a>.
                When
                subjects are asked if there is a quartier they would refuse to live in under any circumstances, they
                cite the quartiers around Goutte d'Or (quartiers 71, 72, 73, 74).

                The deepest affection for the city is reserved for its central historic areas, with the best-liked
                quartiers falling out in the 6th, followed by 4th, 1st, and 5th arrondissements. Along related
                lines,
                subjects were asked to engage in a pleasant financial fantasy: Suppose you came into a great deal of
                money, and could afford to live anywhere in <a
                    href="paris-as-a-collective-representation.html">Paris</a>. Where would you move to? The
                arrondissements
                exerting
                the greatest residential attraction are, in order of popularity, 6th, 4th, 7th, and 16th. The single
                most desiredlocation is the Ile de St. Louis. Popular with all groups, and particularly so with
                younger
                <a href="recognition-of-parisian-scenes.html">Parisians</a>, 36.2 percent of those under 30
                speculated
                that if they had a financial windfall they
                would
                move there, to the island in the middle of <a
                    href="paris-as-a-collective-representation.html">Paris</a>, but removed from the bustle.

                The subjects' attachment to "le vieux <a href="paris-as-a-collective-representation.html">Paris</a>"
                is
                expressed in a somewhat different form when they
                responded to the following hypothetical problem: Suppose you were about to go into exile, and had a
                chance to take only one last walk through the city. What would be your itinerary;? Each subject was
                given
                an unmarked street <a href="handdrawn-maps.html">map</a> and was asked to trace a final itinerary of
                not
                more than three kilometers.
                Many
                idiosyncratic routes appeared as subjects traced paths through childhood neighborhoods, sites of
                romantic encounters, and so on. But when we focus on the commonly selected paths (any street segment
                transversed by at least five of the subjects) a definite pattern is revealed (<o>Fig. 8.13</o>). The
                densest
                network of walks are along the quais of the Seine, on the Ile de la Cite and the Quartier Latin.
                (Smaller numbers of subjects chose to stroll through Place des Vosges, Palais Royale, and
                Montmartre.)
                And a considerable group chose to walk along the Champ Elysees. <a
                    href="paris-as-a-collective-representation.html">Paris</a> contains more than 3500
                streets
                within its limits (Hillairet, 1964), but the concentration of choices on only a score of these
                reveals
                the few which have a shared emotional significance.
