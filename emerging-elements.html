                The sequence that spontaneously emerges as subjects sketch their <a href="handdrawn-maps.html">maps</a>
                of <a href="paris-as-a-collective-representation.html">Paris</a> may tell us what is
                uppermost <a href="introduction.html">in</a> their minds when they think of the city. What is most
                salient is probably what comes out
                first. With this point <a href="introduction.html">in</a> mind, from the outset we had asked our
                subjects to number each element as they
                drew it, emphasizing that the numbering process is to accompany their process of drawing, and not be
                applied afterward.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Most subjects begin their <a href="handdrawn-maps.html">maps</a> of <a
                    href="paris-as-a-collective-representation.html">Paris</a> by
                drawing a rough ellipse designating the city limits. Unlike
                many cities <a href="introduction.html">in</a> the United States, such as Los Angeles, which do not
                possess a strong form and whose
                boundaries bleed off into surrounding areas, <a
                    href="paris-as-a-collective-representation.html">Paris</a> possesses a clear boundary and its form
                impresses
                itself on the inhabitants. The boundary is sharply etched by the peripherique, a highway wrapped around
                the city, separating the city from the densely populated suburbs, and providing a contemporary
                moat-<a href="introduction.html">in</a>-motion to replace the historic walls.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Within the city there are almost a thousand different elements included <a
                    href="introduction.html">in</a> the <a href="handdrawn-maps.html">maps</a> of our subjects, but
                only one feature is the first entry of a large number of participants, the Seine. After the city limits
                are sketched, it is the element that far and away is drawn first. It is not only a basic geographic fact
                of the city, but its most salient psychological fact as well, and much of the subjects' subsequent
                mapmaking is organized around it.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                But there is a serious distortion <a href="introduction.html">in</a> the way the Seine is represented.
                <a href="introduction.html">in</a> reality the path of the Seine
                resembles a wave that enters <a href="paris-as-a-collective-representation.html">Paris</a> at the Quai
                Berey, rises sharply northward, tapers slightly as it
                flows into separate streams around the islands, initiates its flat northernmost segment at the Place de
                la Concorde, then turns sharply <a href="introduction.html">in</a> a great 60° bend at the Place d' Alma
                to flow out of the southwestern
                tip of the city. But <a href="introduction.html">in</a> their drawings, 91.6 percent of the subjects
                understated the river's degree of
                curvature. Several subjects pulled it through the city as a straight line, and the typical subject
                represented the Seine as a gentle arc of slight but uniform curvature.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Because the course of the river is made to resemble an arc of gentle convexity, some subjects find it
                necessary to force the river through the Bois de Boulogne, and there is no space for the Auteuil and
                Passy districts. Accordingly, these districts are eliminated or displaced to the Left Bank.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <o>Figure 8.5</o> compares the actual course of the Seine to the average curvature imparted by the
                subjects.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Why does this systematic distortion occur? Quite clearly it reflects the subjects' experience. Although
                the Alma bend of the Seine is apparent <a href="introduction.html">in</a> high aerial views of the city,
                it is not experienced as a
                sharp curve <a href="introduction.html">in</a> the ordinary walk or drive through the city. The curve is
                extended over a sufficient
                distance so that the pronounced turn of the river is obscured. Such long, slow curves have, <a
                    href="introduction.html">in</a> almost
                all studies of orientation <a href="introduction.html">in</a> cities, proved to be the most confusing,
                and difficult to reconstruct
                (Lynch, 1960).

                We return now to the general question of the sequence with which the elements are set down. After the
                Seine, Notre Dame and Ile de la Cite are set down most often as the first entries. The three elements of
                the Seine, Ile de la Cite, and Notre Dame are at the very heart of the idea of <a
                    href="paris-as-a-collective-representation.html">Paris</a>. Lutece was born on
                the Ile de la Cite; Notre Dame was constructed there 800 years ago. The sequence with which subjects
                enter their elements <a href="introduction.html">in</a> the handdrawn <a
                    href="handdrawn-maps.html">maps</a> recapitulates this history.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Unlike a city such as New York, whose psychological core has shifted continuously northward (and now
                focuses on the area between 34th and 86th Streets), the psychological center of <a
                    href="paris-as-a-collective-representation.html">Paris</a> has remained true
                to its origins, building outward from the Seine, never shifting its center away from its historic root.
                The remarkable stability of the "heart of <a href="paris-as-a-collective-representation.html">Paris</a>"
                confers a dimension of permanence to the city's
                psychological structure.
