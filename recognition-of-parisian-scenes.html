                There are numerous representations of things that a person cannot externalize through drawing or verbal
                recall. He may be able to see a loved one's face in his mind's eye without being able to draw it. But he
                is likely to recognize it if shown a photograph. And the same is true of cities. A person may have
                encoded visual aspects of the city that can be most sensitively uncovered through recognition, that is
                by seeing if the person can match an external stimulus to some memory of it. Accordingly, to supplement
                the method of "free recall" used in drawing <a href="handdrawn-maps.html">maps</a> of the city, we
                presented subjects with 40 photographed
                scenes of Paris, which they were asked to identify. Correct recognition shows that a scene is an
                activepart of the subject's representation of the city, even if he did not spontaneously include it in
                his <a href="handdrawn-maps.html">map</a>. We scored recognition by noting the percentage of subjects
                who correctly identified the scene,
                and as Table 8.3 shows, this ranged from 100 percent for Etoile to under 5 percent for Rue de Cambrai
                and Place d'lsrael. We may touch briefly on four aspects of the recognition data: icons of the city,
                confusions, class differences, and paradoxical unknowns (see <o>Fig. 8.9</o>).
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>
                Icons of the City
            </h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                All of the groups shown the photographs, whether professionals or workers, recognized the same four
                scenes with the greatest degree of accuracy: Etoile, Notre Dame, Place de la Concorde, and the Palais de
                Chaillot. What distinguishes these scenes is not so much their beauty, as their monumentality, special
                historic significance, and scenic grandeur. (To this group one could, without doubt, add the Eiffel
                Tower and Sacre Coeur (Sondages, 1951).) Each of these scenes has come to be indelibly associated with
                <a href="paris-as-a-collective-representation.html">Paris</a>, not merely within the city, but abroad as
                well. One might conclude, therefore, that those sites
                which are universally identifiable among residents serve as internationally circulated symbols of the
                city. This formula is, however, too simple: Denfert Rochereau, with its imposing Lion de Belfort, though
                recognized by 94 percent of the subjects, in no way functions as an international symbol. (This raises
                questions of urban iconography too complex to discuss here. We may also ponder why <a
                    href="paris-as-a-collective-representation.html">Paris</a> is so richly
                endowed with exportable symbols, while such great urban centers as Sao Paulo and Chicago lack them
                entirely.)

            <p>
                In the mental representation of a city, two quite separate geographic locales may be collapsed into a
                single imagined site. Thus, many Parisians mentally combined the nonsectarian Monument de la Deportation
                (located on the Ile de la Cite) and the Memorial du Martyr Jui£ (located in St. Paul) into a single
                locale, believing there is only one such monument, rather than the two that actually exist. Porte St.
                Martin was frequently misidentified as Porte St. Denis, highlighting the psychologically interchangeable
                character of the two arches.
            </p>

            <br>
            <p>
                Class factors shape the <a href="handdrawn-maps.html">maps</a> of the subjects by segregating rich and
                poor residentially, and also by
                transmitting a class-<a href="links.html">linked</a> culture to various segments of the population.
                Thus, Place Furstenberg is
                recognized by 59 percent of the professional subjects, but only 17 percent of the workers; UNESCO
                headquarters by 67 percent versus 24 percent. The icons of the city, however, are recognized equally by
                all groups, serving as integrative <a href="emerging-elements.html">elements</a> in the urban culture.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Paradoxical Unknowns
            </h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                When a city is deficient in fine squares and architecture, mediocre locales may be widely publicized
                because they are the best of what is available. But in <a
                    href="paris-as-a-collective-representation.html">Paris</a>, a surfeit of riches creates an opposite
                situation. Competition for a place in the mind is fierce; many worthy locales are excluded. Thus Place
                Felix Eboue, which displays an impressive and monumental fountain, is recognized by less than half of
                the Parisians, while 87 percent of the subjects cannot identify Place Rodin. Place d'lsrael, which could
                serve as an architectural showpiece, sinks to virtual obscurity-identified by only 4.47 percent of the
                subjects. Locational factors play some part. But more critically, the data highlight how the mental <a
                    href="handdrawn-maps.html">maps</a>
                which Parisians internalize are not only individual products, but are in an important degree <a
                    href="social-perceptions.html">social</a>
                constructions. Any one of these last scenes possesses sufficient aesthetic value to serve as a widely
                known feature of the Parisian environment. If society chose to publicize Place Rodin, the square could
                become as famous as (God forbid) the urinating statue of Brussels. <a
                    href="social-perceptions.html">Social</a> definition determines, through
                selectivity and reiteration, which features of the city acquire salience in the mental <a
                    href="handdrawn-maps.html">maps</a> of the
                inhabitants.
