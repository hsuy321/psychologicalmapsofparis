                In this report we shall explore the way in which Parisians mentally represent their city. It is not an
                examination of <a href="paris-as-a-collective-representation.html">Paris</a> as a geographic reality,
                but rather of the way that reality is mirrored in the
                minds of its inhabitants. And the first principle is that reality and image are imperfectly <a
                    href="links.html">linked</a>. The
                Seine may course a great arc in <a href="paris-as-a-collective-representation.html">Paris</a>, almost
                forming a half circle, but Parisians imagine it a much
                gentler curve, and some think the river a straight line as it flows through the city.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <a href="paris-as-a-collective-representation.html">Paris</a>, the city of stone, is the template from
                which the mental <a href="handdrawn-maps.html">map</a> draws its structure, but it is not
                the same as the <a href="handdrawn-maps.html">map</a>. The person harboring a mental model of <a
                    href="paris-as-a-collective-representation.html">Paris</a> may die, but the city endures. The
                city may vanish through flood or nuclear holocaust, but the <a href="handdrawn-maps.html">maps</a>
                encoded in millions of human brains are
                not thereby destroyed.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The main problem in investigating a mental entity is to learn how to render it observable. The person's
                mental image of <a href="paris-as-a-collective-representation.html">Paris</a> is not like his driver's
                license, something he can pull out for inspection.
                Rather, <br> we shall have to tease the information from the subject, using whatever means psychology
                can
                offer to inspect the contents of the mind (Downs and Stea, 1973).

                It is not quite as easy as simply asking the person. First, many of the concepts people have about
                cities are nonverbal, spatial ideas. They are <br> not easily translated into words, particularly on the
                part
                of <a href=notes-references-appendix.html>subjects</a> of limited education. Moreover, Parisians are all
                exposed to stereotypes about their city,
                readily available cliches, which do not so much tap their personal ideas of the city, as their immersion
                in a world of prepackaged platitudes. We want to get at something more personal and more closely tied to
                direct experience.
